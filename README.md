## Building

Start by grabbing the code using Git. If you're planning to contribute, fork the project on GitHub.

    $ git clone https://github.com/codebutler/firesheep.git
    $ git submodule update --init

See instructions for your platform below. When done, an xpi will be created inside the `build` directory. Load the extension into Firefox by dragging it into the Addons dialog.

### OSX

1. Install boost using [Homebrew][1] (`brew install boost`).
2. Download and extract the [Mozilla SDK][2]. You'll probably want the *i386 Gecko 1.9.2* download.
3. Run autogen, specifying the path where you extracted the Mozilla SDK to (`./autogen.sh --with-xulrunner-sdk=/path/to/sdk`).
4. Run `make`!

### Ubuntu Linux (10.10 Maverick)

1. Install build dependencies (`sudo apt-get install autconf libtool libpcap-dev libboost-all-dev libhal-dev xulrunner-1.9.2-dev`).
2. Run `./autogen.sh` then `make`.

### Windows

This has so far only been tested on Windows XP (32-bit), however the binaries work fine on Windows 7 too. If you can help simplify this process please let me know.

1. You'll need Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. The express edition should work too, but this hasn't been tested. Newer versions of Visual Studio should also work, but the Makefiles might need a bit of tweaking. Patches in this area greatly appreciated.
2. Install [Cygwin][3], selecting the following packages: `automake-1.11`, `gcc-g++`.
3. Install [BoostPro][4]. Choose *Visual C++ 8.0* and *Multithreaded debug, static runtime*.
4. Install [WinPcap][6].
4. Download and extract the [Mozilla SDK][2] (Gecko 1.9.2). 
5. From a Cygwin command prompt: Run autogen, specifying the path where you extracted the Mozilla SDK to (`./autogen.sh --with-xulrunner-sdk=/path/to/sdk`) then run `make`!
