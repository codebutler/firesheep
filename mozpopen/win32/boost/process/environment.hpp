/**
 * Representation of a process' environment variables.
 *
 * The environment is a map that stablishes an unidirectional
 * association between variable names and their values and is
 * represented by a string to string map.
 *
 * Variables may be defined to the empty string. Be aware that doing so
 * is not portable: POSIX systems will treat such variables as being
 * defined to the empty value, but Windows systems are not able to
 * distinguish them from undefined variables.
 *
 * Neither POSIX nor Windows systems support a variable with no name.
 *
 * It is worthy to note that the environment is sorted alphabetically.
 * This is provided for-free by the map container used to implement this
 * type, and this behavior is required by Windows systems.
