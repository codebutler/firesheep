/**
 * Simple RAII model for system file handles.
 *
 * The \a file_handle class is a simple RAII model for native system file
 * handles. This class wraps one of such handles grabbing its ownership,
 * and automaticaly closes it upon destruction. It is basically used
 * inside the library to avoid leaking open file handles, shall an
 * unexpected execution trace occur.
 *
 * A \a file_handle object can be copied but doing so invalidates the
 * source object. There can only be a single valid \a file_handle object
 * for a given system file handle. This is similar to std::auto_ptr's
 * semantics.
 *
 * This class also provides some convenience methods to issue special file
 * operations under their respective platforms.
