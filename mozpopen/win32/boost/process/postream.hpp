/**
 * Child process' input stream.
 *
 * The postream class represents an input communication channel with the
 * child process. The child process reads data from this stream and the
 * parent process can write to it through the postream object. In other
 * words, from the child's point of view, the communication channel is an
 * input one, but from the parent's point of view it is an output one;
 * hence the confusing postream name.
 *
 * postream objects cannot be copied because they own the file handle
 * they use to communicate with the child and because they buffer data
 * that flows through the communication channel.
 *
 * A postream object behaves as a std::ostream stream in all senses.
 * The class is only provided because it must provide a method to let
 * the caller explicitly close the communication channel.
 *
 * \remark Blocking remarks: Functions that write data to this
 *         stream can block if the associated file handle blocks during
 *         the write. As this class is used to communicate with child
 *         processes through anonymous pipes, the most typical blocking
 *         condition happens when the child is not processing the data
 *         in the pipe's system buffer. When this happens, the buffer
 *         eventually fills up and the system blocks until the reader
 *         consumes some data, leaving some new room.
