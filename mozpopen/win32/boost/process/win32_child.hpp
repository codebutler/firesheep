/**
 * Windows implementation of the Child concept.
 *
 * The win32_child class implements the Child concept in a Windows
 * operating system.
 *
 * A Windows child differs from a regular %child (represented by a
 * child object) in that it holds additional information about a process.
 * Aside from the standard handle, it also includes a handle to the
 * process' main thread, together with identifiers to both entities.
 *
 * This class is built on top of the generic child so as to allow its
 * trivial adoption. When a program is changed to use the
 * Windows-specific context (win32_context), it will most certainly need
 * to migrate its use of the child class to win32_child. Doing so is only
 * a matter of redefining the appropriate object and later using the
 * required extra features: there should be no need to modify the existing
 * code (e.g. method calls) in any other way.
