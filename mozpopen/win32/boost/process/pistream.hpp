/**
 * Child process' output stream.
 *
 * The pistream class represents an output communication channel with the
 * child process. The child process writes data to this stream and the
 * parent process can read it through the pistream object. In other
 * words, from the child's point of view, the communication channel is an
 * output one, but from the parent's point of view it is an input one;
 * hence the confusing pistream name.
 *
 * pistream objects cannot be copied because they own the file handle
 * they use to communicate with the child and because they buffer data
 * that flows through the communication channel.
 *
 * A pistream object behaves as a std::istream stream in all senses.
 * The class is only provided because it must provide a method to let
 * the caller explicitly close the communication channel.
 *
 * \remark Blocking remarks: Functions that read data from this
 *         stream can block if the associated file handle blocks during
 *         the read. As this class is used to communicate with child
 *         processes through anonymous pipes, the most typical blocking
 *         condition happens when the child has no more data to send to
 *         the pipe's system buffer. When this happens, the buffer
 *         eventually empties and the system blocks until the writer
 *         generates some data.
